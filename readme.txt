The dataset folder stores all training data and can be divided into training val test datasets by itself

The calculate.py file is used to calculate the evaluation metrics of the object detection model, 
which can evaluate the performance of each model (just change 83 and 84 lines of code to your own path). 
Save the predicted label of the model to the local test code.

The vis.py file is a visualization code that can be used to test the label visualization results 
obtained from one's own model when testing your own model

class.txt stores the class of the dataset

#Each code has detailed comments
